    <p>I'd like to introduce my baby boy.
      <br>
      His name is <i>Sauron</i>. Or as I like to call him.. <em>"The dark hamster."</em> <br>
      <img class="sauron-per" src="/src/images/Sauron.JPG" alt="hamster pic" width="100">
      <br>
      Maybe you'll recognize his name from a book or movie called
      <a href="https://www.warnerbros.co.uk/movies/lord-rings-fellowship-ring" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the
          rings</em></a> .
    </p>
    <img class="sauron-pg" src="src/images/Sauron-2.webp" alt="sauron-lord-of-the-rings" width="80">
    <p>I imagine you wouldn't expect a tiny animal like a hamster be called like that but, what can I say? I'm kind of a
      nerd.</p>

    <h3>Few things that about him</h3>
    <p>Hamsters are usually more active during the night time but, Sauron likes to be different to all the others of his
      species so, usually, he wakes up every time he thinks there's food around.
    </p>
    <p>He doesn't care what you're eating, cooking or if you're just getting his food.
      <br>
      He'll be there, in his cage staring at you until you give him some food or one of his treats.
